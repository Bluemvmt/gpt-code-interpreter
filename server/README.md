## Project Overview

This directory contains the server-side logic for the Code Interpreter project. It interacts with the client, accepts commands and passes them to the Jupyter notebook environment for execution.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Docker is installed in your system.

## Usage

Navigate to the server directory:

```bash
cd server
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running at http://localhost:4050
